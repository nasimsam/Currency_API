<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br>
In this project, I used FastAPI to employ currency API for rapid development and efficient routing. I used external APIs for real-time data. 
Endpoints are created to add functionality to currency API such as currency exchange rates, cryptocurrency prices, and a list of available cryptocurrencies.
